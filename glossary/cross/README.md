## Cross
Calculate the cross product of two vectors

### Declaration
```glsl
vec3 cross(vec3 x, vec3 y)
```

### Parameters
```x``` specifies the first of two vectors

```y``` specifies the second of two vectors

### Description
```cross()``` returns the cross product of two vectors, ```x``` and ```y```. The input parameters can only be 3-component floating vectors. The cross product is equivalent to the product of the length of the vectors times the sinus of the(smaller) angle between ```x``` and ```y```.
